### me

I'm a Master's student exploring the intersection of **hardware, software, and science** â€” from embedded systems to quantum technologies.

On the summer of 2025, I completed a **CERN Summer Studentship** at **LHCb**, where I developed ACAI - An Automated Clock-Oriented Acquisition Infrastructure to support data acquisition of hardware testing for next LHCb updates.  
Iâ€™m always interested on **system-wide views and architectures**, so far I have mostly explored **firmware**, **hardware/software co-design**, and some **network computing**. But I am always eager to new fields and currently focusing a bit on **quantum technologies**
Huge fan and supporter of Free and Open Software, as well as open knowledge. I am certain that collaboration and transparency are the ways to make more science of more quality, and have more fun doing it :)

### featured project

#### [CERN / LHCb Summer Studentship](https://github.com/seraconti/acai)

> A Python-based toolset built to support data acquistion workflows and data management for the LHCb collaboration.
developed modular tools in `Python` with clean CLI and config-driven design
integrated CERN tooling and workflows into user-friendly automation scripts
wrote documentation and followed software engineering best practices
But hey, dont let those 3 sentences describe it, go check it out ;)
